    <title><anchor id="uc1"/>Explanation</title>
    <para>The Universal Century is the setting of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and it is also by far the most developed and revisited to the Gundam timelines. Set in the future after mankind has created space colonies in orbit around the earth. Stories in the universal century mostly tell the tale of the wars between the Earth Federation, the one-world government, and Zeon a nation of rebelling space colonies. As time goes on both alternate between which plays the antagonists, mostly Zeon, though it often turns out that they both are.</para>
    <para>Much of the stories focus on the genesis of the space-born psychics, Newtype, who may have the potential for enabling humanity to move past war through achieving mutual understanding or maybe just escalate the war and horrifying new directions further. Further down in the Universal century chronology, the Zeon versus Federation dynamic is superseded by several stand-alone wars between people vaguely associated with the federation and other non-Zeon space-dwelling bad guys but, there are very few stories set in that bit and so who cares?</para>
    <para>When people talk about the Universal Century, they tend to focus on its grit, the Shades of Grey aspects of its politic and the relatively grounded nature of its character and stories. It’s definitely the timeline that brings the most nostalgia, which has a lot to do with why they keep adding more and more series within the same year-long span as the original series.</para>

        <title>Personal Thoughts</title>
        <para>If you’re the kind of person with is interested in seeing what counts as “CLASSIC” Gundam or to whom complex space politics and retro styling may appeal, the universal century is certainly worth checking out. Of course, being the most revisited setting, it has the most baggage, but there’s a self-contained plot through-line made up of Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack.</para>

      <para>Amuro Ray (アムロ・レイ Amuro Rei) is one of the main characters from the Universal Century timeline. He is the protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam, a supporting character in the sequel Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and the protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. A Gundam pilot and a Newtype, he is most famous for piloting the powerful RX-78-2 Gundam during the One Year War.</para>
      <para>Amuro has a certain knack for mechanics, including building the famous talking ball-shaped robot named Haro. Initially, when Amuro pilots the Gundam, he is barely able to fend off aces such as his main rival Char Aznable and Ramba Ral, mostly relying on the sheer incredible power of the Gundam. However, over time, Amuro manages to hone his skills to the point where a mobile suit he pilots needed a huge upgrade and tuned to even able to match up to Amuro's immense piloting skill.</para>
      <para>Onboard the first mobile suit he piloted, the RX-78-2 Gundam, he is able to use and fight with it by just looking in the piloting manual for the first time, and was able to destroy two Zakus at the same time. Amuro is adept at any combat situation he is in, whether in close-combat, middle-range, and even long-range, earning him the title "White Devil". At UC 93, Amuro is at the peak of his piloting skill, able to use an inferior mobile suit, the RGZ-91 Re-GZ, to critically damaging Gyunei Guss' MSN-03 Jagd Doga, which was far advanced that time, and is noted that the Re-GZ is not suited for Amuro's expectations until Anaheim Electronics soon delivers him the RX-93 ν Gundam, which is designed by Amuro himself to use his Newtype powers to the fullest, thus, utilizing his full piloting potential.</para>
      <para>In addition to his Newtype powers and skills, he's shown to use pragmatic and clever tactics over his career, often catching his enemies off guard, such as the feint he used against Gyunei.</para>

      <title>Char Aznable</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Char_0079.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Char_0093.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Char Aznable (シャア・アズナブル Shaa Azunaburu?), born Casval Rem Deikun (キャスバル・レム・ダイクン Kyasubaru Remu Daikun), is one of the main characters from the Universal Century timeline. He was introduced as one of the antagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam and later becomes one of the protagonists of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam before finally returning as the main antagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. Throughout his life, he was also known by the aliases Édouard Mass (エドワゥ・マス Edowa~u Masu) and Quattro Bajeena (クワトロ・バジーナ Kuwatoro Bajīna). In addition, he is given the nom de guerre of "The Red Comet (赤い彗星 Akai Suisei?)", for his performance at the Battle of Loum during the One Year War.</para>
      <para>As a mobile suit pilot, Char excels in all situations. He would exploit the disadvantages of his foe and use them to his advantage. Char is also able to bring out the full potential of a mobile suit, and is able to hold his ground against the technologically superior RX-78-2 Gundam with commander versions of the Zaku, Z'Gok, and Gelgoog. It is said that Char's Zaku was three times faster than regular mobile suits, and while Char does request his suits to be optimized for speed and maneuverability in addition to commander suits being 20% faster than regular suits, it is actually his abilities that make the mobile suit he is piloting three times as fast. Char flies so fast that he seems to leave a comet's tail, and being that his mobile suits during the One Year War were red, he earned the moniker of "The Red Comet" during the war.</para>
      <para>The days at the Zeon Space Defense Military Academy helped him hone his combat skills as a foot soldier, such as using firearms, detonating explosives, and fencing. His bold leadership which he is well known for was also developed at the military academy. Albeit being an excellent pilot, Char's abilities as a Newtype are far less than those of his archrival Amuro Ray. Char's Newtype abilities only developed as a result of long-term training. Char is also a cunning strategist and tactician, managing to outsmart many of his enemies, even when he is not piloting a mobile suit.</para>

      <title>Kamille Bidan</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Kamille.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Kamille Bidan (カミーユ・ビダン Kamīyu Bidan) is the main protagonist of the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam television series and a supporting character in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. He is the pilot of the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam.</para>
      <para>According to Yoshiyuki Tomino, Kamille has the strongest Newtype powers in the Universal Century series. Most of his Newtype powers did not manifest itself until the late portions of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, however, he is augmented by contact with Cyber-Newtypes such as Four Murasame and Rosamia Badam, even Elpeo Ple.</para>
      <para>The strongest points of his power are revealed when he uses Zeta Gundam's Waverider Mode to crash Paptimus Scirocco at the end of the series. He is filled with strength from the souls of slain Newtypes who are close to his heart. Although the mental death throe by Scirocco destroyed his mind, he begins to recover in ZZ Gundam and became even more powerful than before. He is able to contact and speak with characters such as Ple telepathically and even sense what they do while still functionally comatose. At the end of ZZ Gundam, he lent his powers to Judau Ashta, allowing the Jadau to defeat Haman Karn.</para>

      <title>Judau Ashta</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Judau.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Judau Ashta (ジュドー・アーシタ Judō Āshita) is the 14-year old protagonist in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. He later returns as a supporting character in Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: Skull Heart and Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Outside Story under the alias Grey Stoke (グレイ・ストーク Gurei Sutōku).</para>
      <para>Judau is brash and smart-mouthed. His need for money is because he wishes to help his little sister, Leina Ashta, to have a better future. Because of this, he often skips school to work as a junk dealer. He also resorted to stealing the Zeta Gundam multiple times before becoming a full-time mobile suit pilot.</para>
      <para>Judau seems to despise adults, blaming them for the war that is now occurring. However, this attitude slowly changes as he becomes a pilot, soon wishing to end the war while trying to protect Leina. He believes that the war should be stopped, and views the fighting as pointless as more and more lives are being lost each day.</para>
      <para>His perspective on Bright and the rest of the Argama crew also change as well, becoming good allies with all of them and even changing their own opinions regarding the war, such as when Bright had the chance to destroy a colony, but did not when Judau convinced him.</para>
      <para>Judau is not quite skilled in physical combat, but does know how to sneak around at times to avoid detection. His real power comes in piloting a mobile suit. While sloppy at start, he is able to improves over time and performs admirably with the ZZ Gundam.</para>
      <para>As a Newtype, his Newtype powers are said to rival Char Aznable's. In the finale, deceased Newtypes and Kamille Bidan lent Judau their powers, allowing him to combine the ZZ Gundam without the need for two more pilots and drastically enhance the output of the Gundam's high mega cannon.</para>

      <title>Banagher Links</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Banagher.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Banagher Links (バナージ・リンクス Banāji Rinkusu) is the main protagonist of the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn novel, its OVA adaptation, and the television recut. Originally a student at Anaheim's Technical College, he became the pilot of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam, the key to Laplace's Box.</para>
      <para>Banagher is proficient in piloting mobile suits, which could be attributed to him being a student at Anaheim's Technical College. It is shown in the novels that he has some knowledge of how to troubleshoot and pilot mobile suits, making it slightly easier for him to understand the Unicorn Gundam's control systems upon receiving it.</para>
      <para>Banagher is also portrayed as a Newtype with very high potential. He is instantly able to control the Unicorn in Destroy Mode during his first time in the cockpit, dodging beams from a large number of funnels and defeating the NZ-666 Kshatriya in 1-on-1 combat. Additionally, despite the malintent apparently programmed into the NT-D, Banagher learns to exert his will strongly enough to resist the will of the psycommu. Later during the war, he is fully capable of initiating and shutting down the NT-D and the Unicorn's Destroy Mode at his will.</para>
      <para>His brainwaves are displayed to reach supernatural levels, which, combined with the Unicorn Gundam's extensive psycho-frame, are able to manifest themselves physically. They are shown to have enough power to move and destroy nearby solid objects and, eventually, enable the use of the Full Armor Unicorn's shields as remote weapons, manipulating the psycho-frame that runs through them. Upon mastering both the NT-D and Banagher's own powers, over time the psycho-frame of the Unicorn Gundam changes from red to green, responding to the growing magnitude of his Newtype ability.</para>

      <para>The RX-78-2 Gundam is the titular mobile suit of Mobile Suit Gundam television series. Part of the RX-78 Gundam series, it was built in secret on Side 7. The Gundam would turn the tide of war in favor of the Earth Federation during the One Year War against the Principality of Zeon. It was primarily piloted by Amuro Ray.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>The Gundam was incredibly advanced for its time. Built from lightweight Luna Titanium Alloy, its frame was both lighter and sturdier than that of Zeon's mass-produced mobile suits, able to shrug off a MS-06 Zaku II's machine gun fire with little to no damage. </para>
        <para>For the weaponry, RX-878-2 was equipped with a beam rifle, two beam sabers which could be extended into a spear-like beam javelin, a hyper bazooka, and a pair of small vulcan guns, a "Gundam Hammer" which is then upgraded into the "Hyper Hammer" and a shield.</para>
        <para>In terms of technology, the Gundam was equipped with a sophisticated Learning Computer which would collect pilot's and enemy data during skirmishes and allow the Gundam to operate more effectively. In addition, RX-78-2 was upgraded shortly before the Battle of A Baoa Qu to improve its reaction times, the joints of the Gundam were given a Magnet Coating, based on the experimental procedure performed on the RX-78-3 "G-3" Gundam and later used on Amuro's intended successor unit, the RX-78NT-1 Gundam "Alex".</para>

      <para>The RX-93 ν Gundam is a mobile suit that appears in Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. It was designed and piloted by Amuro Ray.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>The ν Gundam is one of the most advanced mobile suits during the Second Neo Zeon War, it is used by Amuro Ray who also came up with it's design. It was manufactured at Anaheim Electronics' Von Braun plant. Its design is based on the average specification values of each successive generations of Gundam-type units from the original RX-78-2 Gundam to the MSZ-010 ΖΖ Gundam, together with the latest state-of-the-art technologies. Various test data collected from the Silver Bullet (Funnel Test Type), μ Gundam and the RX-9 Narrative Gundam were also used for development.</para>
        <para>The ν Gundam's design focuses on versatility operational aspects, as well as emphasis on reliability and durability for protracted battles. It adopts unitized parts that are designed according to EFF standards, except for the Psycho-Frame, for easier procurement of parts and materials and reducing special components as much as possible. It can be easily repaired due to maintenance feedback and combat data. In addition, it reflects Amuro Ray's experience as an MS pilot cultivated over the years.</para>
        <para>Incorporating the Psycho-Frame technology secretly provided to Anaheim Electronics by Char Aznable of Neo Zeon, the ν Gundam was able to utilize Psycommu weapons and channel the emotions and mental energies of a Newtype pilot. It is also the first Gundam-type to be equipped with Funnels, and a newly developed MS control program is installed to account for the ν Gundam's center of mass during the separation and movement of the Funnels.</para>
        <para>Despite its short development time, the ν Gundam proved itself to be a formidable mobile suit and when combined with legendary ace pilot Amuro Ray's immense skill and experience, this powerful, state-of-the-art machine was able to almost single-handedly hold back the whole Neo Zeon force, and its Psycho-Frame was put to the test to determine the history of humanity living on earth.</para>

      <para>The MSN-04 Sazabi is a mobile suit that appears in Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. It is piloted by Char Aznable.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>With an overall height of 25.6 meters, the Sazabi is much bigger than most standard mobile suits, but thanks to the use of lightweight armor materials and a great number of thrusters, it is much faster and maneuverable than other suits. The suit is armed with an abdomen-mounted scattering mega particle cannon, a beam shot rifle, a pair of beam sabers stored in the arms and a shield with three missiles as well as a beam tomahawk.</para>
        <para>Because Char is a Newtype, the Sazabi was also equipped with six funnels which the pilot could control through his psycowaves via a Psycommu system. The Sazabi was also the first MS to be equipped with the revolutionary new psycoframe cockpit. This system featured microscopic psycommu receiver circuits installed throughout a mobile suit's internal frame and cockpit walls. These tiny circuits amplify and transmit a Newtype pilot's psycowaves, enabling the mobile suit to respond instantaneously to mental commands.</para>

      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Zeta_front.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Zeta_back.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Zeta_Waverider.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>The MSΖ-006 Zeta Gundam (MSΖ-006 Ζゼータ ガンダム) is the titular mobile suit of the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam television series and also featured in the Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ television series. It was most famously piloted by one of its principal designers, Kamille Bidan, during the Gryps Conflict.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>The Zeta Gundam is a high-performance, next-generation MS developed by Anaheim Electronics in partnership with the AEUG as part of the "Project Zeta" which aims to develop a transformable mobile suit capable of operating in space and on earth. The completed Zeta Gundam also incorporated design ideas from the AEUG's Newtype pilot, Kamille Bidan, who served as the mobile suit's first main pilot.</para>
        <para>The main feature of the Zeta Gundam is its ability to instantly transform into the Waverider mode, which can fly at high speed. Furthermore, this mode also allows the Zeta Gundam to ride the shockwaves of atmospheric re-entry, thus it can enter the atmosphere without any external help. This atmospheric re-entry capability is thanks to the incorporation of the Flying Armor into the mobile suit's back (bottom in waverider mode), which is developed using the data of the Gundam Mk-II's FXA-00 Flying Armor.</para>
        <para>The Zeta Gundam is armored with the new lightweight Gundarium Gamma alloy, and has a variety of weaponry such as a pair of head-mounted vulcan guns, two beam sabers stored which can also be used as beam guns in Waverider mode, two forearm-mounted grenade launchers, a beam rifle with retractable barrel, and a shield. If higher firepower is needed, it also have a hyper mega launcher in its weaponry. The Zeta Gundam is also one of the first mobile suit to use the Bio-Sensor, a variant of the Psycommu system that allows a Newtype pilot to more easily interface with his mobile suit via mental commands. </para>

      <para>The MSZ-010 ΖΖ Gundam (aka ΖΖ Gundam, ZZ; pronounced "Double Zeta") is a mobile suit of the anime Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and is piloted by Judau Ashta.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>A direct development of the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, the ΖΖ Gundam, which had been completed through a prototype, was given the development code "θ" as it was the sixth "Anaheim Gundam" after the Rick Dias. </para>
        <para>The ΖΖ Gundam sought to reproduce the operating functions of the RX-78-2 Gundam combined with the G-Armor into a single machine. An advanced form of the RX-78-2 Gundam's Core Block System was also introduced into this program and as the results, the ΖΖ Gundam can transform into a mobile armor form called the G-Fortress, which can act as a heavy combat bomber and for cruising in space and on earth. The ΖΖ Gundam can also separate into two independent fighter units, called the Core Top and Core Base. The Core Base, consisting of the ΖΖ's lower body and backpack. The Core Top, consisting of the ΖΖ's upper body and double beam rifle.</para>
        <para>The engine installed in the backpack is originally meant for ships and could supply power for an entire ship. It also functions as the main thruster unit of the ΖΖ Gundam when in MS form, generating thrust equivalent to that of a large ship. The ΖΖ Gundam's armor is a multi-spaced structure composed of Gundarium γ alloy, capable of withstanding a mobile suit explosion at close range and resisting high water pressure.</para>
        <para>The control system of the ΖΖ Gundam is equipped with a Bio-Sensor, which is a simplified Psycommu system, as an interface for Newtype pilots. An improved version of the Biosensor installed in the Zeta Gundam, it improves the responsiveness of the mobile suit by supporting the control system with the pilot's brainwaves. However, as a protective measure, the Biosensor is inactive when a pilot with low Newtype abilities boards the ΖΖ Gundam.</para>
        <para>The ΖΖ Gundam's weaponry, consisted of two hyper beam sabers on his backpack which can also be used as beam cannons, a double beam rifle, a 21-tube missile launcher, and a high mega cannon on the forehead. While the ΖΖ has a very destructive arsenal, its weapons systems require a high level of energy. As a result, the ΖΖ often found itself almost completely drained of power after using its high mega cannon.</para>

      <para>The RX-0 Unicorn Gundam (ユニコーン ガンダム Unicorn Gundam, Singularity One) is the prototype mobile suit developed by Anaheim Electronics for the Earth Federation, it concealed a secret that could shake the future of all humanity, for it was the key to opening Laplace's Box. It is piloted by Banagher Links after the head of the Vist Foundation and his father, Cardeas Vist, entrusted it to him at the dawn of the Third Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0096.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>Produced as the final part of the E.F.S.F's reorganization plan, the "UC Project", the Unicorn Gundam is a revolutionary design meant to be the main symbol of the project's main goal: to destroy any traces of Zeon in the Earth Sphere. Thus, not only does it feature a Gundam design, but it also incorporates an anti-Newtype system. However, when the Vist Foundation took control of the project, they installed a special "La+ Program" OS into the Gundam, turning it into a symbol of possibility by making it the key to finding Laplace's Box: the embodied hope of the Universal Century.</para>
        <para>Featuring the most advanced mobile suit technology of the time, its performance is unmatched. Incorporating test data from the experimental MSN-06S Sinanju Stein, the Unicorn Gundam's entire frame is built with Psycho-Frame material, drastically increasing the unit's responsiveness and allowing it to be piloted like an extension of the pilot's body. While mobile suits used during the Second Neo Zeon War implemented Psycho-Frame technology on a limited basis, the Unicorn is the first "full Psycho-Frame" mobile suit. In some cases, this responsiveness is so high that the machine appears to act on its own without any actions from the pilot. In addition, the Unicorn utilizes a special system known as the "NT-D" (or Newtype Destroyer) which activates the suit's Psycho-Frame and dramatically increases the suit's performance.</para>
        <para>In its normal form, the "Unicorn Mode", the Unicorn Gundam's head is similar in appearance to those of Londo Bell's mass-produced mobile suits, with the addition of a single, horn-like antenna on its forehead (which gives it the name "Unicorn"). Destroy Mode is the form when Unicorn Gundam's NT-D System is activated. The transformation is marked by an expansion of the suit's frame. The armor seams separate and lock down into various hard-points, while the newly exposed Psycho-Frame emits a pinkish-red or greenish (Awakened) glow. In this mode, the Unicorn becomes taller, reveal six more thrusters, and its head transforms to one with standard Gundam features. To prevent its transformation being interrupted, the strength of its I-Field will be increased temporarily. Additionally, a pair of sub-sensors are revealed on the shoulders, and two concealed beam sabers extend out of the backpack.</para>
        <para>In Destroy Mode, the suit's Psycho-Frame scans the pilot's thoughts and directly transmits them to the suit's drive system; in other words, the Unicorn can be controlled by the pilot's thoughts alone. Additionally, the mode also causes the machine's performance to be increased to unmeasurable levels. The NT-D also allows the Unicorn to take control of an enemy's psycommu weapons. However, the stress placed on the mind by manipulating an object more than tenfold the size of an average human is extraordinary. Even with the aid of the Psycho-Frame, the pilot's mind can only endure roughly five minutes of operation before a limiter is activated, deactivating the Psycho-Frame and returning the mobile suit to its Unicorn Mode.</para>
        <para>With the performance limiters disengaged, the Unicorn is able to accelerate up to 20 G's in Destroy Mode; to cope with such high levels of G forces placed on the pilot, a drug administration system called the "DDS" is fitted on the pilot suit. It is able to suppresses stagnated blood circulation due to high acceleration. Furthermore, the DDS activates automatically upon the detection of another Newtype via the "Intention Automatic System".</para>
