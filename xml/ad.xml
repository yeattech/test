    <title><anchor id="ad1"/>Explanation</title>
    <para>Gundam 00 is set in Anno Domini.(PS: that's our calendar!) In Gundam 00, our modern-day nation-states have mostly conglomerated into three federated superstates, UNION or “Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations”, “Advanced European Union and, “Human Reform League”. They’ve solved the energy crisis by constructing space elevators connected to massive solar energy harvesting rings in orbit. Meanwhile, the smaller non-confederate states find themselves in a constant state of economic collapse, terrorism, and military conflict.</para>
    <para>In the year 2307 A.D, a mysterious paramilitary organization, Celestial Being, suddenly appears. Declaring war on the war itself, using strange Mobile Suits called “Gundam”, interfering in any military actions across the globe.</para>
    <para>Celestial Being’s Gundam pilots are the Gundam Meisters, a varied cast of ace pilots with hilarious code names, such as Lockon Stratos, a cool sniper guy. Alleluia Haptism, failed super-soldier psychic with two personalities. Thierry Ardey, a mysterious cyborg clone hacker, and our protagonist, Setsuna F. Seiei, a former child soldier who now goes around telling people he's a Gundam. They all have arcs and go through their own trials and tribulations but they're honestly kind of banal compared to the rest of the big ensemble cast.</para>
    <para>There are civilian characters impacted by Celestial Being's actions. The world government is trying to make sense of the various obvious contradictions of Celestial Being’s motivation. There's also this great underdog element as the very outclass militaries and aces across the three military blocks, trying to figure out ways to take down the Gundams. For most of the early goings, 00 doesn't even have an explicit antagonist, until suddenly there is as some inside Celestial Being begun to turn its motives sinister.</para>

        <title>Personal Thoughts</title>
        <para>00 is overall pretty good, it has a unique plot and setting, and it's kind of just doing the Gundam Wing’s pacifist teen terrorism with attitude thing, with more coherency. The action looks great, the mecca is neat and it's pretty hilarious at times.</para>

      <para>Setsuna F. Seiei (刹那・F・セイエイ Setsuna Efu Seiei) is the main protagonist of the story in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. He is a Gundam Meister of the paramilitary organization Celestial Being and is humanity's first True Innovator. In season 1, he pilots GN-001 Gundam Exia and he pilots GN-0000 00 Gundam and its upgrade, the GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser in season 2. He pilots the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie -A wakening of the Trailblazer-.</para>
      <para>Trained by Ali al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare. He is also been trained by CB to know some MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam. </para>
      <para>Due to the power of 00 Gundam's concentrated GN particles with Trans-Am Raiser, Setsuna's brain has been gradually enhanced to utilize quantum brainwaves. He's able to sense quantum brainwaves (QBWs) near him and track users of QBWs. Eventually, he naturally evolves into humanity's first true/genuine Innovator. </para>
      <para>Setsuna's Innovator capabilities aren't completely defined as he's the first naturally evolved Innovator. He can anticipate movements and actions of his opponents and also sense impending danger from far distances. As an Innovator, he has strengthen reflexes, longer lifespan, and can communicate his thoughts via quantum brainwaves. </para>
      <para>After Setsuna joined the ELS, his body is not entirely human. The ELS reformed his body based on their bio-technology, forever retaining his youthful appearance with a metallic shine.</para>

      <title>Lockon Stratos (Neil Dylandy)</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Lockon-Neil.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Lockon Stratos (ロックオン・ストラトス Rokkuon Sutoratosu), born Neil Dylandy (ニール・ディランディ Nīru Dirandi), is a Gundam Meister and one of the main characters in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. As a Gundam Meister for Celestial Being, Lockon piloted the GN-002 Gundam Dynames in Season 1 of Gundam 00. After Lockon's demise, his younger twin brother Lyle continues his legacy as the next Lockon Stratos. </para>
      <para>Lockon possesses a superb sharpshooting skill and proficient knowledge with a wide array of firearms. As a trained sniper, he knows about stealth tactics and has an intuitive understanding of trajectory physics. Even before becoming a Gundam Meister, he was known to score high grades in sports marksmanship.</para>
      <para>Among the Gundam Meisters, Lockon is the most easy going of all. Despite his difference with others, he never let it stop him from helping out in times of needs. He never criticizes people based on the wrongdoings they had done in the past. When someone is misunderstood, he is the one that tries to let other people, even himself, understand. He's also there for them when they felt doubts or when they expressed their sorrow. He also has an orange Haro, which he brings along with him every time.</para>
      <para>While Lockon is kind and considerate, he also has a dark side. When it comes to dealing with terrorists, he lets his judgement get blinded by anger rooted from his traumatic past. When he was young, he witnessed the KPSA suicide bombing that killed his family. Because of the violent death of his family, he developed a deep hatred on terrorists. Sadly, it was this blind anger that later led to his tragic demise.</para>

      <title>Lockon Stratos (Lyle Dylandy)</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Lockon_Lyle_Movie.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Lockon Stratos (ロックオン・ストラトス Rokkuon Sutoratosu), also known by his real name, Lyle Dylandy (ライル・ディランディ Rairu Dirandi), is a Gundam Meister and one of the main characters in the Second Season of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. Lyle is the younger identical twin brother of Neil Dylandy, the original Lockon Stratos from Season 1. Appearing in Season 1, Lyle Dylandy is a member of Katharon, and later inherited Neil's position as a Gundam Meister in Season 2. In Celestial Being, Lockon pilots the GN-006 Cherudim Gundam. Lockon stayed in Celestial Being after the events of Season 2, and pilots the GN-002RE Gundam Dynames Repair and the GN-010 Gundam Zabanya in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie -A wakening of the Trailblazer-.</para>
      <para>When Lyle first introduced himself in Celestial Being, he said that he didn’t have any experience from piloting a mobile suit. It was soon proved to be false, as Celestial Being’s assessment of Lyle’s skills actually showed high marks in Mobile Suit piloting and shooting skills from the get go.</para>
      <para>While he does excel in marksmanship in general, he was only second to the previous Lockon, Neil in sniping. However, Lyle’s style proved to be more well rounded, with more use of the pistols and shield bits to fight up close, reflecting his more headstrong and spontaenous personality compared to that of his brother's more deliberate approach to things. The data gathered from this style of combat, was the concept behind the creation of the GN-010 Gundam Zabanya.</para>
      <para>Aside from piloting a Mobile Suit, it can be inferred that Lyle has some knowledge in spying and infiltration tactics as well, since he was once an agent secretly working for Katharon.</para>
      <para>Like his older brother Neil, Lyle is a flirty and laid-back person. Aside from having the same looks, he’s also care-free and straight forward. When there’s an opportunity, he would take a chance to lighten up the mood of everybody. He also cares deeply for his friends. He’s quick to notice his teammate’s problems and does not hesitate to give advice about them. However, despite being virtually the same in all aspects, Lyle’s greatest dislike is being compared to Neil.</para>

      <title>Allelujah Haptism</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Allelujah_season1.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Allelujah_season2.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Allelujah_Movie.png" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Allelujah Haptism (アレルヤ・ハプティズム Areruya Haputizumu) is a Gundam Meister and one of the protagonists in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. Allelujah was an escaped failed-experimental super-soldier, who made his way into Celestial Being. He piloted the GN-003 Gundam Kyrios during Season 1; the GN-007 Arios Gundam in Season 2. He also pilots the GN-011 Gundam Harute with Soma Peries in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer.</para>
      <para>Allelujah is a genetically modified human, called a Super Soldier, developed by the HRL's Super Human Research Institute. Allelujah was surgically implanted with quantum brainwaves for super reflexes and a modified body to maintain his peak physical condition; Allelujah's mind and body were configured specifically for combat purposes. However, even with such abilities, the scientists in the institute deemed him a failure for having a murderous split personality. Unknown to them, the two personalities can work as one and bring about the true potential of the Super Soldier they desired.</para>
      <para>The two personalities have their own range of specialty. Allelujah being the one to think about tactics during combat. Hallelujah, being the one responsible for their reflexes and their battle intuition. When uniting both their strengths, they act as dual processing mind with a reflexive body, giving them a superb advantage in the battlefield.</para>
      <para>Towards the end of the Battle of Lagrange 1, Allelujah suffered a head injury that affected his ability to properly use quantum brainwaves,reducing him to perform at a normal human level. However, after repeated exposure to high grade GN Particles from 00 Raiser's Trans-Am System,Hallelujah and his quantum brainwaves eventually returned, allowing his return to the super soldier he once was.</para>
      <para>As a Super Soldier, in contrast to Soma Peries, there seems to be no clear indication of how well Allelujah can utilize his quantum brainwaves. It is also notable how Allelujah seem to be connected to Soma's other personality, Marie, through quantum brainwaves. Back in the research institute, Allelujah seems to be the only one who can pick up and respond to Marie's quantum brainwaves. Furthermore, in Season 1, Allelujah and Soma experience headaches due to their quantum brainwaves repelling each other due to having the same wavelengths.</para>

      <para>Tieria Erde (ティエリア・アーデ Tieria Āde) is a Gundam Meister and one of the protagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. Tieria is also an Innovade. As a Gundam Meister, Tieria is assigned to pilot the GN-005 Gundam Virtue during Season 1; he later pilots the GN-008 Seravee Gundam in Season 2. After the events in Season 2, Tieria becomes part of Veda as its living consciousness and holographic interface within Celestial Being. He operates CB-002 Raphael Gundam in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie: A wakening of the Trailblazer.</para>
      <para>As an Innovade, Tieria was created to adapt to the conditions of space and use of quantum brainwaves (QBWs). With his quantum brainwaves, Tieria is able to fully connect to the entire network of Veda, allowing him access to all information Veda has, up to Level 7. Specifically designed as a Combat-type Innovade, Tieria has high potency in MS combat and coordinated military tactics for effectiveness in the battlefield. It was noted that he could control Nadleeh just by thoughts alone.</para>
      <para>Entrusted with the power of Trial System, Tieria had the ability to disable any unit that was connected to Veda. Due to Ribbons Almark's tampering with Veda (AD 2307, season 1), Tieria was locked away to access Veda and couldn't interface his Gundam to activate Trial System.</para>
      <para>During the 4-year gap (AD 2312, Season 2), Tieria further enhanced his training in aspects of MS engineering, MS combat, and general battleship operational skills; making him a more versatile Gundam Meister. Tieria's brainwaves could be enhanced through exposure to high-grade and concentrated GN particles, stimulating his quantum abilities. After Tieria's consciousness was transferred to Veda, Tieria had full control of the resources Innovators had access to, including access to Trial System for Seraphim Gundam.</para>
      <para>As Veda, he has the ability to expand his mind and will throughout the limits of computer networks. He can interface with all of CB technology and contains all the secrets of CB and Innovators. He also has remote access to manufacturing MS facilities to create mobile suits at his discretion and facilities to clone himself a new body. This allows Tieria to return to his physical form whenever he wants. Should his physical body be killed, his consciousness is transferred back to Veda. As a living consciousness within Veda, he can also transfer himself to any Veda-terminal and access data and systems, including GNT-0000 00 Qan[T]. Because Tieria has no age limit and can exist as living data, he is essentially immortal so long as his consciousness survives.</para>

      <para>The GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser, is the combined and mainstay form of GN-0000 00 Gundam and GNR-010 0 Raiser in mid-season 2 of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. The unit is co-piloted by Setsuna F. Seiei piloting the 00 Gundam and Saji Crossroad piloting the 0 Raiser. However, when combined Setsuna can operate both units himself.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>Despite its power, the GN-0000 00 Gundam actuallyis a highly experimental unit. The Twin Drive System was also a very new technology, requiring the external stabilizing equipment on 00's main support unit, the GNR-010 0 Raiser, to safely execute Trans-Am and fully synchronize the GN Drives.</para>
        <para>As the 00 Raiser and the Twin Drive reaches 100% synchronization rate, it can achieve GN Particle generation rates which far exceeding 300% during Trans-Am and also gains the usage of the Raiser System. The Raiser System allows the 00 Raiser to execute powerful attacks such as a massive GN Beam Saber called the "Raiser Sword", allowing for greater close combat abilities, and using Trans-Am mode with even greater power and duration. While in Trans-Am, 00 Raiser has also been seen utilizing quantum teleportation.</para>
        <para>The power of 00 Raiser is further enhanced with the presence of an Innovator pilot. Once such a being is detected, the Twin Drive can execute Trans-Am Burst, a massive flood of purified GN Particles across a massive area. Overall, 00 Raiser is a mobile suit that exceeds the performance of all others, surpassing the very concept of "Gundam".</para>

      <para>The GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] is the successor to the GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie: Awakening of the Trailblazer, piloted by Setsuna F. Seiei.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>As the successor to GN-0000+GNR-010 00 Raiser, 00 Qan[T] contains an upgraded and improved Twin Drive System and possesses the new Quantum System. The unit possesses two newly created GN Drives specifically made for its Twin Drive System. The drives are located on its back and underneath the shield respectively. They can also be directly connected with each other which would result in a higher sync rate and output, however when used this way they become extremely hard to control.</para>
        <para>The Quantum System is also the successor to 00 Raiser's Trans-Am Burst System, which allows Setsuna to expand his quantum brainwaves. It creates a massive quantum field that extends an Innovator's consciousness to communicate with sentient minds for advanced communications. 00 Qan[T] can quantize like 00 Raiser, but with improvements over the original, it is now able to execute this function at will. Unlike 00 Raiser, 00 Qan[T] is capable of quantizing all the way across the universe as shown in the movie. 00 Qan[T]'s Sword Bits have the ability to form a portal and aid in the process.</para>
        <para>Like its predecessors, 00 Qan[T] is a close combat-oriented mobile suit. Its primary weapon is the GN Sword V, the latest in the line of dual functioning weapons that can alternate between sword and rifle modes. The GN Shield can deploy 6 GN Sword Bits that can serve many functions, but mostly as remote blades. The Sword Bits can be attached to the GN Sword V to form either a powerful buster sword or a buster rifle for combat. For added defense, 00 Qan[T] can deploy a GN Field by placing the 6 Sword Bits in a closed spherical formation and can activate the Trans-Am System to enhance its overall capabilities.</para>
        <para>Being Celestial Being's most advanced MS to date, the 00 Qan[T] is so powerful that in theory could possibly have eliminated the entire ELS attack force single-handedly had Setsuna chosen not to communicate with them. However, it should be noted that this is just a hypothetical calculation by Veda. It excludes important factors such as ELS' healing abilities, and the physical impossibility of the pilot fighting without food or rest over a whole week of constant battling, making it a very difficult feat to achieve.</para>

      <para>The GN-010 Gundam Zabanya is the successor unit to GN-006GNHW/R Cherudim Gundam GNHW/R featured in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie -A wakening of the Trailblazer-. The unit is piloted by Lockon Stratos.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>Zabanya is a departure from its lineage as a long-ranged sniper, more emphasis on mass fire tactics while retaining its sniper capabilities. The reason of this is because the previous Lockon Stratos, Neil Dylandy is more of a sniping-oriented pilot, while the Lyle Dylandy prefers a more direct combat preferences, emphasising on dealing with multiple targets.</para>
        <para>When the gun camera as well as the other sensors are deployed all at once, a special screen would appear in the cockpit to facilitate targeting and shooting of multiple enemy simultaneously. Zabanya's predecessors, utilized a single Orange Haro for support, but due to the complexity of managing its weapons systems, a second Haro port was installed into Zabanya's cockpit. A blue-colored Haro now co-processes the data with the other Haro to allow Lockon to pilot the Zabanya more effectively.</para>
        <para>Weapons-wise, the GN Missile Pods are laced under its expandable green armor plating and the GN Rifle Bits II contained within the GN Holster Bits. For defence, the GN Holster Bits can swivel in various positions for optimum defense and the bits can detach or combine into pairs to protect Zabanya. When facing superior numbers, Zabanya can unleash the GN Rifle Bits II from within the GN Holster Bits, allowing Zabanya to fight off 10+ targets at the same time. The Rifle Bits II can also be reconfigured as GN Pistol Bits II by removing the long barrel.</para>
        <para>Using its huge armory, Zabanya utilize the en masse firing tactics to quickly and systematically annihilate large groups of enemies. When greater firepower is needed, the Holster Bits can configure themselves into various configurations with the Rifle/Pistol Bits II and Zabanya can equip an additional 4 GN Holster Bits onto its back. The overall capabilities of the Zabanya can also be enhanced by the Trans-Am System.</para>
        <para>An interesting change in pilot interface was that instead of a manually operated rifle control module as with the Zabanya's predecessors, the Zabanya instead has two pistol-grip controllers installed. This was most likely done due to its new emphasis on artillery tactics rather than precision sniping. The removal of the large rifle control module also gives the pilot more room in the cockpit,enlarging the perspective of the battlefield.</para>

      <title>GN-011 Gundam Harute</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Harute_front.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Harute_rear.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Harute_MA.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>The GN-011 Gundam Harute, is the successor unit to GN-007 Arios Gundam in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie -A wakening of the Trailblazer-. The unit is piloted by Allelujah Haptism and co-piloted by Soma Peries.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>Harute's overall design is derived from the combined data of GN-007 Arios Gundam, GNR-101A GN Archer and GNR-010/XN XN Raiser. One of the most unique features of Harute is its cockpit. The cockpit is built similar to 21st century fighter cockpits, both seats have helm controls for co-use and support. While Allelujah focuses on aerial combat tactics, Soma focuses on weapons and systems control. Because of their quantum brainwaves, they can communicate, delegate commands, and change tactics between each other. The combined abilities of the two super soldiers are capable of bringing out the full potential of Harute's speed and firepower.</para>
        <para>Harute has a less aerodynamic design than its predecessors, but it can achieve far greater speeds. This is due to six thrusters acting as its primary propulsion, creating large bursts of acceleration. For even more speed, two GN Boosters can be attached onto its legs, giving the unit even more speed and mobility in both MS and MA mode.</para>
        <para>Many aspects of its weapons and technology were derived from the incomplete XN Raiser project. Harute's GN Sword Rifles can also act as wings and cleavers in its fighter form. When launched from Ptolemy, the wings remained folded upwards to adjust its limited space. The rifles attached to the wing are retractable. The blade-wings allow Harute to cut and/or gouge through enemy targets on either side of its wings.</para>
        <para>GN Archer's head sensor and propulsion system survived and evolved onto Harute's frame. The new MS developments have miniaturized the GN Verniers, making the entire system smaller and allowing more space for other systems. The original large intake ports have been replaced with a pair of GN Cannons, capable of acting as heavy firepower beam armaments. In addition they also act as a container for the GN Scissor Bits to help Harute manage against superior enemy numbers.</para>
        <para>One revolutionary feature of Harute is the Marute System, a special OS that can accommodates a three-pilot control simultaneously with the result of improved overall performance. Overall, Harute represents the pinnacle of CB's transformable Gundams, able to draw out the latent abilities of its super soldier pilots, becoming a force to be feared on the battlefield.</para>

      <title>CB-002 Raphael Gundam</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Raphael_front.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> <inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Raphel_rear.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>The CB-002 Raphael Gundam, is the successor of the GN-008GNHW/B Seravee Gundam GNHW/B. Featured in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie -A wakening of the Trailblazer-, and is piloted by Tieria Erde. </para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>Like its predecessor, Raphael's backpack contains a hidden second Gundam. The true form of the Raphael's backpack is actually the GN-008RE Seravee Gundam II. Unlike the GN-009 Seraphim Gundam, the Seravee II is an unmanned combat unit which receives commands from Tieria's quantum brainwaves.</para>
        <para>Like its predecessors, the Raphael is a high-particle-consuming moblie suit. A significant difference is that Raphael is the only Gundam in Celestial Being that not possessing a true GN Drive. Instead, Raphael draws power from three GN Drive Taus which all located in Seravee II.</para>
        <para>The attached GN Drive Taus give the remote cannons incredible speed and power, as well as giving them longer operating time by acting as the cannons' own dedicated power source. If more firepower is needed, Raphael can also detach its backpack-mounted GN Bazookas for greater firepower. However, Raphael isn't capable of creating bazooka/cannon combinations like the original Seravee. The GN Bazookas originally had a hollowed bottom, allowing both ends of the bazookas to connect and form more varying kinds of blasts to adapt different combat situations.</para>
        <para>Overall, the Raphael is a formidable unit of great firepower. Although using the inferior GN Drive Tau rather than an original GN Drive, the Raphael is still able to match CB's other Gundams in terms of combat performance for a limited time. Its overall systems can be enhanced with the Trans-Am System. For final measure, Raphael can also self-destruct by overloading its Trans-Am.</para>
