    <title><anchor id="bf1"/>Explanation</title>
    <para>The Build Fighter series, sets in a version of our world where Gundam is the singular unifying global cultural touchstone. The story follows Sei Iori, a young Gunpla builder, whose parents own a model store. One day, he meets an odd red-headed foreigner named Reiji, who somehow has never even heard about Gundam, let alone the latest global craze, Gunpla Battling.</para>
    <para>In the sport of Gunpla Battling, players use custom Gundam models to battle in holographic arenas. When exposed to the Plavsky Particle created by the Gundam battling system, Gunpla are able to move and use their weapons as if they were real, this means that build quality, loadout and customization are key the performance of Gunpla.</para>
    <para>Sei is a Gundam aficionado, and a masterful builder and Reiji is a battling genius. Together, the two team up with Reiji fighting using Sei’s customized Gunpla, the Build Strike Gundam, aiming to win the Gunpla Battle World Championship. Along the way, they'll meet foes from across the world, learn more about themselves, and even discover the secrets behind the Plavsky Particle.</para>
    <para>Obviously, the stakes are considerably lower than your average Gundam series. This allowed the producer to make a Gundam series that operates more as a comedy. For example, there is a combination beach slash onsen episode that goes roughly as one expected but then somehow ends with defeating onsen menacing yakuza in a gunpla battle.</para>
    <para>This ridiculousness continuously escalates with Gunpla martial arts, Gunpla mafiosos and other ridiculous things. The whole premise is just ridiculous, yet it does take Gunpla very seriously. There's this notion that Gunpla is this singular profound craft that exceeds all others, so long as you're having fun which is itself ridiculous.</para>

        <title>Personal Thoughts</title>
        <para>So, is Build Fighters worth watching? Yes, it doesn't require any pre-existing Gundam knowledge to enjoy it, but you'll have a better time if you can pick up on all the Gundam cameos and goofs. Detached from Gundam, it's just a fun anime about two friends competing in a futuristic fighting game tournament scene.</para>

      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Sei.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Sei Iori (イオリ・セイIori Sei) is one of the two main protagonists of Gundam Build Fighters. He is the builder of the GAT-X105B/ST Star Build Strike Gundam and the SB-011 Star Burning Gundam.</para>
      <para>Sei is a young boy whose family runs Iori Hobby Shop in a small town, His father was a Gunpla Battle champion many years ago, and Sei has inherited his skill at building and customizing Gunpla, but not the skill and sense in piloting one. Because of this, he has Reiji pilot his Gunpla while he takes charge of analyzing the opponent to provide navigational and tactical data during battle.</para>
      <para>Over the course of the World Tournament, Sei matures not only as a builder but also as a pilot, now no longer a pilot that just about anyone can toy around and trash within seconds. While still not as good as Reiji and Ricardo Fellini, he is now capable of holding his own ground against top class pilots, as seen in his battle with Reiji at the festival.</para>
      <para>It was then revealed by Reiji that what getting in the way of allowinf Sei to become a good fighter isn't the lack of piloting skills or anything. It's his due to his subconscious reluctance of damaging a Gunpla. Reiji also added that to be a good fighter, he needs to have the resolve to win regardless of the odds, including severe damage on the Gunplas from both sides. These words finally unshackled Sei's restraints, enabled him to use his piloting skills fully, allowing him to go head-on against top-tier pilots like Tatsuya Yuuki.</para>

      <title>Aria von Reiji Asuna</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Reiji.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Aria von Reiji Asuna (アリーア・フォン・レイジ・アスナ Arīa fon Reiji Asuna) simply known as Reiji (レイジ Reiji) is one of the two main protagonists of Gundam Build Fighters.</para>
      <para>Reiji is a mysterious boy who Sei Iori encounters in town, he is overbearing, selfish, quick to anger and lacking in manners, because he is from a different planet, Reiji has shown a naivety with Earth customs, such as comparing Rinko Iori and China Kousaka's breast sizes out loud, ending with him getting slapped. However, Reiji has shown a noble side, helping others in their times of need. He is also a battle genius, able to quickly got his hands on Gunpla battle and rivals the Italian Champion's piloting skills, just a few days after starting Gunpla battle</para>
      <para>Reiji initially has no idea about anything of Gunpla or Gunpla Battle, and was only into it for returning Sei's favor and that it seemed fun to defeat other Gunpla. Over the course of the time he spends on Earth, he gets more and more interested in Gunpla due to Sei's influence and other players around, eventually culminating in him building his own Gunpla - a GPB-X80 Beginning Gundam.</para>

      <para>Tatsuya Yuuki (ユウキ・タツヤ Yūki Tatsuya), also known as Meijin Kawaguchi III (三代目メイジン・カワグチ Sandaime Meijin Kawaguchi), is a character first featured in the Gundam Build Fighters television series. He also appears in Gundam Build Fighters Try as a supporting character.</para>
      <para>Tatsuya Yuuki is the president of the student council and captain of the model-building club. Having to won the Japan 3rd Block Championship in the previous year, he is the school's top Gunpla Fighter and Sei and Reiji's rival. His piloting skills earned him the nickname "Crimson Comet" (紅の彗星 Kurenai no suisei).</para>
      <para>In the middle of the current Gunpla Battle Japan 3rd Block Qualifying Tournament, Tatsuya is forced to bow out of competition and take an indefinite leave from school due to a personal emergency, which centers around his involvement with Plavsky Particle System Engineering (PPSE). However, he once again faces Sei and Reiji in an unsanctioned Gunpla Battle that ends with both Gunpla destroyed.</para>
      <para>Following this battle, Tatsuya resurfaces at the 7th Gunpla Battle World Championships as the PPSE Works Fighter, the third Meijin Kawaguchi (三代目メイジン・カワグチ Sandaime Meijin Kawaguchi).</para>
      <para>As the current Meijin, Tatsuya vows to bring back the fun and joy of Gunpla building, which was disregarded by his predecessor's philosophy of absolute victory.</para>

      <title>Sekai Kamiki</title>
      <para><inlinegraphic fileref="#image/Sekai.jpg" width="0.7862inch" depth="0.3929inch"/> </para>
      <para>Sekai Kamiki (カミキ・セカイ Kamiki Sekai) is the main protagonist of the Gundam Build Fighters Try television series.</para>
      <para>It appears that Sekai doesn't know that much about social activities, such as when he told his sister that he was going out on a date. He then asks her questions about dates, such as what to wear. Unlike both his teammates, who often concerned with winning, he only enjoyed fighting battles for enjoyment, and gets excited fighting someone strong and never for once shows any worries about the possibility of losing.</para>
      <para>Being considered as the "Second coming of Reiji" due to his natural flair for Gunpla battle, Sekai also bears a strong resemblance to Reiji in both appearance and personalities. Like Reiji, Sekai initially has no knowledge about Gunpla or Gunpla Battle and was only interested in Gunpla because he found a outlet to use his martial arts skills and it's fun fighting battles. He begins to learn more about Gunpla throughout his fights and gradually fall in love with Gunpla, eventually dedicate himself to learn more about Gunpla and grow as both a builder and a fighter. Similar to how Reiji did not notice Aila's romantic feelings for him, Sekai is also dense in this part as even though Fumina, Kaoruko, and Shia are fighting for his affection right in front of him, he still has no clue about it.</para>

      <para>Wilfrid Kijima (キジマ・ウィルフリッド Kijima Uirufuriddo) is a character that appears in Gundam Build Fighters Try. He is acknowledged by Sekai Kamiki to be his rival.</para>
      <para>Wilfrid Kijima, the team leader of Celestial Sphere, is the most level-headed and intelligent among the three. He desires little more than a good fight, he desire to have someone who can fight together with him seriously and goes all out, thus he cannot stand fighting against anyone who doesn't even try and tends not to fight as hard as he himself. Saga Adou mentioned that his hunger and thirst for a full-hearted battle exceed even his and he becomes vexed fighting half-hearted foes.</para>
      <para>However, this changed when he fought Sekai Kamiki. Seeing his resolve and eagerness, he even discarded the Gunpla's weapon in order to fight on equal terms. While Saga was his rival and sparing partner for the longest time, Saga himself admits that fighting Sekai was the greatest enjoyment Wilfrid ever had. Wilfrid's other goal is to become the next Meijin after Tatsuya Yuuki.</para>

      <para>The GAT-X105B/ST Star Build Strike Gundam is a Gunpla featured in Gundam Build Fighters, an upgraded version of the GAT-X105B/FP Build Strike Gundam Full Package. It's built by Sei Iori and primarily controlled by Reiji. </para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>The Star Build Strike Gundam is the upgraded version of the Build Strike Gundam Full Package, which Sei Iori designed for the Gunpla World Tournament. It retains all of the original weaponry from its predecessor, together with some redesigned and new features. It also have a new backpack called the Universe Booster, which is armed with two beam cannons or act as an independent fighter if separated. Sei also implemented the knowledge he learned while building the Build Gundam MK-II into this Gunpla. Giving this Gunpla a similar inner frame to the former's movable frame</para>
        <para>The Star Build Strike also has three special Plavsky Particles-manipulating systems: the Absorb System, the Discharge System and the Radial General Purpose (RG) System. The Absorb System allows the Gunpla to absorb enemy beam attacks through its shield, converting and storing the beam attacks into more Plavsky Particles for later use. The Discharge System's main purpose is to create a "Plavsky Power Gate" that enhance the Gunpla's performance in a specific area with the cost if higher Plavsky Particles output. The adaptation of an inner frame gave rise to the RG System, which allows the Plavsky Particles to spread all in and out of the Gunpla, increasing its overall performance. In this form, the Star Build Strike is able to perform its strongest attack, the "RG Build Knuckle".</para>

        <para>This Gunpla is a modified version of the completed Gundam Amazing Exia, which sole purpose of creation is to defeat Reiji and Sei Iori. The Exia Dark Matter's colour scheme altered from its predecessor from blue and white to red and black. It is equipped with the Brinicle and Prominence Blade for close combat, a Dark Matter Rifle for ranged combat, and two arm-mounted GN Vulcans one on eacg hand, which can also act as beam sabers. The suit also equipped with a back-mounted support unit - the Dark Matter Booster and the "Trans-Am system", which is a system that in theory can increase the Plavsky Particles output by 3 times. The Dark Matter booster can also detatch from the Gunpla and functions as a separate unit.</para>

        <para>Built by Meijin Kawaguchi, the Amazing Red Warrior is a customized built version of the PF-78-3 Perfect Gundam III "Red Warrior". This is also the Meijin's way of honoring Takeshi Iori, Sei Iori's father, who had used the Perfect Gundam. The Gundam Amazing Red Warrior is able to reach overwhelming speed during battle due to its greatly improved thrust, and has high maneuverability thanks to the flexibly mounted vernier units above the shoulder armors. The weapon mounted on the backpack can be changed to meet the needs of different situations. The combination of the Gunpla's incredible performance with the Meijin's top-tier piloting skills caused this Gunpla to be a formidable foe for any opponent.</para>

      <para>The TBG-011B Try Burning Gundam is a Gunpla from Gundam Build Fighters Try. It is a upgraded version of the BG-011B Build Burning Gundam, piloted by Sekai Kamiki. </para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics</title>
        <para>When compared to its predecessor, the Build Burning Gundam, the Try Burning has reinforced joint armor and was installed with a new system known called the "Burning Burst System". This system allows the Gunpla to maximize its Plavsky Particle emission. Similar to its predecessor, Try Burning's clrear blue parts can be used to store large amount of Plavsky Particles for later use. Although the Gunpla has no shield, it is able to defend ranged attacks by using its elbow armor to deflect them.</para>
        <para>When Sekai assimilates with Try Burning, its performance of this Gunpla is able to improves by more than 3 times. The clear blue parts would also turn into bright orange. Furthermore, all the Plavsky Particles stored in the suit can be released at once, engulfing the Gunpla in flames effects. The suit would also be granded the ability to form a barrier during assimilation. During assimilation, the damages taken by the Gunpla would be reflected onto Sekai, therefor weakening the assimilation.</para>
