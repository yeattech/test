          <h2 id="ce1"><u>Explanation</u></h2>
          <p>In the Cosmic Era, the Earth is orbited by several space colonies called “Productive Location Ally on Nexus Technology” or PLANTS, whose inhabitants are known as coordinators, test tube super babies, genetically enhanced to human perfection. They do not get along well with the natural humans still on Earth, to the point of nuking each other, until the PLANTS' military arm, the “Zodiac Alliance Freedom Treaty” or ZAFT, invented technologies that prevent nuclear reactions from occurring. ZAFT also invented battery-powered Mobile Suits which led them to dominate the earth alliance in the war until the federation secretly develops Mobile Suits of their own.</p>
          <p>Hidden in a neutral space colony, these new Mobile Suits possess special armor technology that makes them impervious to physical damage. ZAFT finds out about this and attempts to steal them but a teenage student, Kira Yamato ends up taking control of one, the Strike and is forcibly conscripted into the earth alliance military.</p>
          <p>Turns out, Kira is himself a coordinator and his childhood friend, Athrun Zala, is piloting one of the stolen Gundam. The conflicts as a whole are made very personal, it's not just a kid thrust into a war he didn't sign up for, it is Kira being forced to fight his friend, Athrun, and their challenges and reconciling their places, being both friends and unwitting enemies as they kill each other’s other friends. It's also Kira dealing with the fact that he's working for a military where people hate him as he is a coordinator.</p>
          <p>SEED is kind of the ultimate realization of the ethos and philosophy that led to the Wing Gundam, taking character-driven melodramatic hyperreality and then injecting it into the core narrative arc of the series. Don’t even get started on Gundam SEED Destiny, Gundam SEED Destiny is even more divisive even among fans of SEED.</p>

          <h4><u>Personal Thoughts</u></h4>
          <p>If you're looking for harder science fiction and the more grounded Mecca action that the rest of Gundam is known for, this might not be for you. On the other hand, if what you want is an anime character drama couched in a lot of pretty lasers blasting into space, try giving this series a try.</p>

          <h2 id="ce2">Characters</h2>

          <h3>Kira Yamato</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Kira_71.png" alt="Kira_71.png">
          <p>Kira Yamato (キラ・ヤマト) is the main protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and the main protagonist of the second half of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Kira is the adopted son of Caridad Yamato and is Cagalli Yula Athha's twin brother. He pilots the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam, the ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam, and the ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam.</p>
          <p>Kira has a dislike of war and conflict, he is more than willing to fight if it means protecting his friends and loved ones. As the series progresses, Kira becomes traumatized by the people he has killed and the ones he failed to protect, showing that he is atychiphobic (afraid of failure) and resulting in him to becoming obsessed with protecting the Archangel.By the Second Alliance-PLANT War, Kira's overall personality is calmer, mature, and philosophical. He has gained respect from soldiers in Orb's military due to his piloting skills and being the brother of Orb's ruler.</p>
          <p>Kira has a sharp sense and rapid information processing ability; He is shown to have great adaptability through his constant improvement of the Strike Gundam's incomplete OS to enhance its performance to match with the combat situation he faces. Kira has exceptional mobile suit shooting precision which has became the core of his piloting style after acquiring the ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. By the end of the Second Alliance-PLANT War, Kira was able to singlehandedly shot down all of the DRAGOONs from the Legend Gundam.</p>
          <p>While lacking any true form of military training, Kira's fighting ability developed quickly and greatly as his time in combat increases, along with his mastery of SEED mode. In contrast to his piloting capabilities, Kira is shown to be inexperienced with handguns, preferring not to use them, as shown when he throws a gun at an assailant during a terrorist attack instead of firing it. By the Second Alliance-PLANT War, however, his handgun skills have improved significantly seen in the second assassination attempt on Lacus Clyne at Copernicus City on the Moon.</p>

          <h3>Athrun Zala</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic_square" src="image/Athrun_73.png" alt="Athrun_73.png">
          <p>Athrun Zala (アスラン・ザラ Asuran Zara) is the deuteragonist of both Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Originally, close friend of Kira Yamato, he later became Kira's rival during the First Alliance-PLANT War, where he participated in the Gundam extortion plan. He became the pilot of the GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam and waged a fierce fight against Kira. In the later stages of the war, they would return to being friends, as well as being comrades opposed to both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT.</p>
          <p>As described by Lacus Clyne herself, Athrun is a quiet, reserved, and often a benevolent individual. Athrun is shown to have a firm belief that if soldiers follow their orders then eventually the war will end with success. While good at following orders, Athrun has trouble acting as a team leader due to his compassionate outlook in life.</p>
          <p>Before becoming a full-fledged pilot, Athrun had underwent training at the ZAFT military academy. It was there that he showed natural talent as a soldier, ranking 1st in mobile suit piloting, hand-to-hand combat, and knife-fighting. His fighting style is not visibly limited in style, his mobile suits, GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam, the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam and later the ZGMF-X19A ∞ Justice Gundam, are all well-rounded mobile suits that are always equiped with sufficient firepower and a few beam sabers.Athrun is also pretty skilled in robotics, as evidenced by his creation of Kira's Birdy and Lacus's Haros.</p>
          <p>Athrun's resolve in battle is often profound. He debates "truth", "war" and even the real difference between "right" and "wrong" on the battlefield. These thoughts never cloud his mind in the sense that they hinder his abilities. However, his anger or desire for revenge often make him act in a way that he later regrets. His only weakness as a pilot is his good nature, which leaves him troubled when faced with having to kill Kira, his best friend.</p>

          <h3>Cagalli Yula Athha</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic_landscape" src="image/Cagalli_73.png" alt="Cagalli_73.png">
          <p>Cagalli Yula Athha (カガリ・ユラ・アスハ Kagari Yura Asuha) is a character that appears in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Cagalli the adopted daughter of Uzumi Nara Athha, Chief Representative and "Lion" of Orb Union. She is also Kira Yamato's twin sister, although neither sibling was aware of this until the First Alliance-PLANT War. Cagalli's birth name is Cagalli Hibiki. She is well known for piloting the Strike Rouge during the First and Second Alliance-PLANT Wars, though she later pilot the Akatsuki Gundam, only once to fight against ZAFT in their invasion of Orb and later giving it to Mu La Flaga.</p>
          <p>Although raised as a princess in Orb, Cagalli is far from it, for she has been shown to be quite stubborn, rebellious, and often free spirited. Cagalli is also shown to dislike being called a princess, when someone calls her one, she instantly tells them don’t call her that again. Despite rebelling against both her father and her responsibilities as a princess, she is quite loyal to her country and was willing to give up her life to save it. In Destiny, Cagalli becomes the leader of her country in place of her father. However she is shown to be reluctant in speaking against the pro-Alliance leaders of Orb and had trouble difficulty in handling situations when it involves her country's future. Eventually she discovers that she is a capable leader and both her people and herself regained their trust in her.</p>
          <p>As the ruling Princess of Orb, Cagalli is shown to have competent diplomacy skills when dealing with foreign policy. While fighting with the Desert Dawn in Egypt, it is presumed that she is skilled in basic combat training and the usage of firearms. In MS combat, Cagalli is seen as a decent mid-range combatant, but needed an AI program to assist her during her first sortie with the Strike Rouge. This is ironically in contrast to her lover Athrun Zala, who has a penchant for hand-to-hand MS combat. Although she is a Natural, Cagalli is capable of going into SEED mode in battle like Kira and Athrun, as evidenced when she avenges the deaths of M1 Astray pilots Asagi Caldwell and Juri Wu Nien, by destroying the Strike Daggers that took them out. So far in the Cosmic Era, Cagalli is the only Natural to have gone into SEED mode.</p>

          <h3>Shinn Asuka</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Shinn_73.png" alt="Shinn_73.png">
          <p>Shinn Asuka (シン・アスカ Shinn Asuka) is one of the main characters from the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny television series. A refugee from the Orb Union, he was a pilot aboard ZAFT's LHM-BB01 Minerva during the Second Alliance-PLANT War, initially piloting a ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam and then a ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam.</p>
          <p>Since his family’s tragic death, Shinn has become impulsive, stubborn, hot-tempered, and occasionally arrogant - even to his superior officers. Despite all anger and sorrow, Shinn has shown to be a very kind and gentle person mainly to his two love interests, Lunamaria Hawke and Stella Loussier, both of whom he is very protective of. He still deeply saddened by the world's cruel actions and all the people that have died in his life; despite his conflicted emotions, he fights for wanting to change the world for the better.</p>
          <p>Shinn's fighting style has similarities with the previous two protagonist as a one man army. His improvement can be seen throughout the Second Alliance-PLANT War until he was eventually able to take down the Freedom single-handedly. Shinn is not without his weakness, he is shown to be inapt at dealing with mobile weapons. This proves to be his personal combat flaws as he took a direct hit from Strike Freedom's dragoons to confuse and broke through his defences in the final battle.</p>
          <p>Shinn is talented and favours close range combat. He's also good in medium and long range combat. Later in the series, Shinn Asuka learns to tap into SEED mode. While in SEED Mode, Shinn Asuka's fighting style became even more aggressive making him an unstoppable force to just about any pilots with exception of the two Legendary Aces and War Heroes; Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala.</p>

After switching to the ZGMF-X666S Legend, he was also able to single-handedly fight and destroy at least one of the massive GFAS-X1 Destroy mobile suits. Able to maintain coolness in tough battles along with good situation analysis, Rey often assumes a leadership role to help keep a more hot-blooded Shinn calm while creating openings for his partner to attack. Apart from his skills as a pilot, Rey has been shown to be an adept piano player.</p>

          <h3>ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Strike-freedom-front.jpg" alt="Strike-freedom-front.jpg">
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Strike-freedom-rear.png" alt="Strike-freedom-rear.png">
          <p>The ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam is the successor of the Freedom Gundam. Appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, it is piloted by Kira Yamato.</p>
          <h4>Technology & Combat Characteristics</h4>
          <p>As this Gundam was tuned to meet the needs of Kira, the Strike Freedom tuned and equipped with almost all the best technologies at that era. Not ony it came with the Variable Phase Shift Armor, to stick with Kira's fighting style, it was also equipped with a lot of powerful ranged weapons. It's weaponry consists of head-mounted CIWS, an abdomen-mounted multi-phase beam cannon, hip-mounted railguns, combine-able beam sabers and beam rifles, DRAGOON pods controlled by the new Super DRAGOON system and beam shields. It is also powered by the new Hyper-Deuterion Engine, and is also equipped with the Neutron Jammer Canceller and the Voiture Lumiere propulsion system.</p>
          <p>Due to Kira’s amazing piloting skills, his mobile suit is rarely hit during combat and thus Strike Freedom’s design emphasizes maneuverability over its armor’s defensive capabilities, though beam shields were installed as a compensatory defensive measure. As a result, its armor is split into smaller pieces to improve the movement range of the joints allowing for wider movement. To compensate for exposing more of its internal parts, the suit's internal skeleton and joints adopted PS armor materials. When these parts phase-shift, they gain strength and near human flexibility. Additionally, excess residual energy within the body can be discharged through the joints' glowing effects which is seen to be gold-colored.</p>
          <p>The internal PS armor materials also help to withstand the massive output and Gs caused by the Hyper Deuterion engine and the new propulsion system. However, the main contributor to the MS's superior mobility are the mobile weapon wings, which can be deployed in the "High Mobility Aerial Tactics (HiMAT)" Mode to enhance the suit's mobility. The wings also features a variant of the "Voiture Lumiere" propulsion system, which can generate a visual effect called the "Wings of the Skies" and is used as a means of high speed movement.</p>
          <p>The Strike Freedom's Super DRAGOONs are based on ZAFT's second gen DRAGOON system. Designed for Kira's use, they allow him to hit more targets at once using the Multi Lock-On System and Full Burst Mode. They also grant Kira the ability to hit the enemy from multiple directions remotely. Like the Freedom, Strike Freedom is designed to operate alongside another mobile suit, in this case, the ∞ Justice Gundam and is stationed on board the warship Eternal. It also can dock with the METEOR unit to further increasing its firepower.</p>

          <h3>ZGMF-X19A ∞ Justice Gundam</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Infinite-justice-front.jpg" alt="Infinite-justice-front.jpg">
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Infinite-justice-rear.png" alt="Infinite-justice-rear.png">
          <p>The ZGMF-X19A ∞ Justice Gundam is a mobile suit and the successor to the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam. It appears in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny and is piloted by Athrun Zala.</p>
          <h4>Technology & Combat Characteristics</h4>
          <p>Developed as a successor to the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam, the ZGMF-X19A ∞ Justice Gundam also incorporates technology from ZAFT's Second Stage Series such as the Variable Phase-Shift Armor. Adjustments were also made to fit Athrun Zala's combat data. The ∞ Justice's close combat capability is enhanced over its predecessor's and is armed with a number of unique weapons such as leg beam blades and a carrier beam shield that is a combination of a beam shield, a beam boomerang and a grapple stinger.</p>
          <p>The ∞ Justice carries a flight unit on its back that can be either deployed as a separate support unit or as a subflight unit. This Fatum-01 is an improved version of the original Justice's Fatum-00, it came with a pair of beam cannons and a few beam blades. The suit can also dock with the METEOR unit for additional firepower as well as speed, and can fire at multiple enemy units simultaneously wuth the hemp of the Multi Lock-On System. As with the Justice, ∞ Justice is design to operate alongside another mobile suit, in this case, the Strike Freedom and is stationed on board the warship Eternal. The ∞ Justice is also equipped with Neutron Jammer Canceller, Hyper-Deuterion Engine, and has joints as well as inner frame made of PS armor materials.</p>
          <p>The Hyper-Deuterion Engine, is a new type of nuclear reactor and due to its massive output, the ∞ Justice has extremely high mobility and maneuverability. Meanwhile, the phase-shifting of its joints and inner frame as a result of the PS armor materials give them strength and near human flexibility while also enhancing the suit's combat abilities. Additionally, the ∞ Justice is able to discharge excess residual energy within the body through the joints' glowing effect, which is silver. The ∞ Justice has a shorter V-fin than its predecessor as the performance of the sensor unit within the head crest has been greatly enhanced.</p>

          <h3>ORB-01 Akatsuki Gundam</h3>

          <img class="ce_pic_square" src="image/owashi.jpg" alt="owashi.jpg">
          <p>The ORB-01 Akatsuki Gundam is a Mobile Suit introduced in the anime Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. It is initially piloted by Cagalli Yula Athha using the "Oowashi" Sky Pack, and later by Mu La Flaga using the "Shiranui" Space Pack.</p>
          <h4>Technology & Combat Characteristics</h4>
          <p>The Akatsuki Gundam was developed through the fusion of the knowledge that the Orb engineers had gained from studying the Strike Gundam and its Striker Pack support system, with newer Orb-based prototype technologies. Its most remarkable feature is its gold-colored armor. This armor is actually a mirror surface armor which is able to deflect, making the mobile suit virtually impervious to beam shots. However, its vulnerability to melee and physical weapons remained equal to that of any other mobile suit, hence the presence of a shield as part of its armaments. Its standard armaments include a twin beam saber, head-mounted CIWS, an arm-mounted shield, and a beam rifle. </p>
          <p>The Akatsuki can also equip two optional backpacks, which are derived from the Strike Gundam's Striker Packs. On Earth, it can use an aerial backpack known as "Oowashi", granting it atmospheric flight capabilities. The backpack is armed with two beam cannons, the Oowashi can separate from the mobile suit and transform into a support aircraft. When operating in space, the Akatsuki uses the other backpack called the "Shiranui". This backpack increases the suit's mobility and was equiped with seven remote control beam turret units that have offensive and defensive capabilities.</p>

          <h3>ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam</h3>

          <p>The ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam is the titular mobile suit of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny and was piloted by Shinn Asuka.</p>
          <h4>Technology & Combat Characteristics</h4>
          <p>The ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam is a high performance general-purpose MS commissioned by ZAFT Chairman Gilbert Durandal, who ordered it to be incorporated with the most advanced technology of the time, including banned technologies. Based on the ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam and Shinn Asuka's combat data, it is designed to handle any combat situations. For close battle, it has two beam boomerangs that double as beam sabers, a pair of palm beam cannons, and a large beam sword. For ranged battle,it has a long-range beam cannon and a beam rifle. For defense wise, it mounts a small physical shield as well as two beam shield generators. Lastly, the suit has a standard set of CIWS.</p>
          <p>For the Destiny Gundam to use its variety of weapons effectively and quickly, it needs to have a wider range of body movements as well as be more flexible. it was able to achieve this by splitting the suit's basic structural components and armor into smaller, movable pieces. The exposed gaps in the armor due to smaller armor pieces are remedied by mapping out the ranges of motion of the frame using Shinn's combat performance to determine the most efficient way to separate the armor parts. This ensures the wider range of body movements while not losing defence capability. To even more increase the flexible, the Destiny's joints are constructed of the same materials found in Phase Shift armor. This allows the joints to possess near-human flexibility when phase-shifted and a faint metallic glow is produced when discharging excess residual energy within the body through the joints.</p>
          <p>Other special aspects are the Destiny's use of the new Voiture Lumiere propulsion system and the use of Mirage Colloid to create illusionary copies of itself. Destiny's Voiture Lumiere propulsion system is installed in the wings, and will produce a special light effect known as Wings of Light during high speed movements. The Voiture Lumiere propulsion system is frequently used alongside the Mirage Colloid to confuse the enemy while the real Destiny sets up for a high-speed attack. Like the Legend Gundam, the Destiny Gundam is powered by the Hyper-Deuterion Engine and armored with Variable Phase Shift Armor. Although classified as a "Second Stage Series" mobile suit, as indicated by the "S" in its model code, the Destiny should be a "Third Stage Series" instead based on its performance. This is done to hide the fact that it is a nuclear-powered suit and should have an "A" instead.</p>

          <h3>ZGMF-X666S Legend Gundam</h3>
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Legend_front.jpg" alt="Legend_front.jpg">
          <img class="ce_pic" src="image/Legend_rear.jpg" alt="Legend_rear.jpg">
          <p>The ZGMF-X666S Legend Gundam is a mobile suit that appears in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny and is piloted by Rey Za Burrel.</p>
          <h4>Technology & Combat Characteristics</h4>
          <p>As the successor of the Providence Gundam, the Legend Gundam is also equipped with the DRAGOON System, however the system is much more advanced and can be used by normal pilots without high spatial awareness. In addtion, the DRAGOON pods have been redesigned and the large pods can now also function as close range weapons.</p>
          <p>Its other weapons consisted of two beam javelins stored in its legs, head-mounted CIWS guns, one beam shield generators on each hands and a beam rifle. Thanks to the additional pair of antennas on its head, the Legend Gundam also has enhanced data gathering capabilities compared to the Providence Gundam.</p>
          <p>Performance wise, the suit is superior to the Second Stage Series and is comparable to that of the Strike Freedom Gundam as seen during their battle. Like the Destiny Gundam, the Legend Gundam is armored with Variable Phase Shift Armor and powered by the new Hyper-Deuterion Engine, granting it sufficient energy to power its energy-intensive weaponry and systems. It also possesses full atmospheric-flight capabilities.</p>
