					<h3>Before we jump into the various timeline, What is a Gundam? </h3>
					<p>Gundam is a super high-performance mobile suit (MS) that is built combining the top-level existing technology with the most recent and powerful experimental technology available at the time they were built. In other words, they're built to be having much higher performance in every way than the standard mass-production MS. Furthermore, the definition of a Gundam differs in every timeline and is used as an acronym to refer to something. However, within the latest series, these acronyms were derived after the fact and doesn’t appear at any point within the animated works.</p>
